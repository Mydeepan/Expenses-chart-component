#Expenses chart component
- `HTML:` Defines a container `div` for the chart.
- `CSS:` Styles the chart container and the bars within it, with div at the bottom.
- `JavaScript:` Uses the JSON data to create `div` elements for each bar, scaling their height according to the amounts and appending them to the chart container.

- This approach provides a basic but effective bar chart using `div` elements.
